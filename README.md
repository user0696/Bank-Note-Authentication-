# Bank-Note-Authentication-

This project is a full-stack web application that utilizes both a backend and frontend, as well as machine learning techniques.

The backend is built using HTML,CSS,JavaScript to desing the frontend part, and it handles the server-side logic of the application. This includes pickelfiles(genrateed from the training model), API routes, and server-side processing.

The frontend is built using Flask, and it handles the client-side logic of the application. This includes user interface, user interactions and dynamic content rendering.

Machine learning techniques are used in this project to classify thet the given note is genuine or counterfeit . The models have been trained using dataset from kaggle and classification technique of machine learning and deployed in the backend to make predictions or learn from the user interactions.In binary classification problems in which time and accuracy are paramount, this allows us to use the
power of Machine Learning.
